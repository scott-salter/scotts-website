## Overview
A client while at Factory Pattern, Coconut Merchant is an online retailer of coconut produce. I managed the SEO, as well as Facebook and Google Ads for their ecommerce store. The campaign to date has been a great success, with a return on ad spend (ROAS) of over 400%. We also generated almost 2,500 new subscribers for their newsletter, a key revenue channel for them.
