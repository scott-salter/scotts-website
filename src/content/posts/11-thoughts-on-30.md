I recently turned 30  in what was a  month of milestones. As well as a momentous birthday, I celebrated my first wedding anniversary with my wife and had my first Father’s Day as a dad.

I decided to put pen to paper (figuratively speaking) and ponder over 30 lessons, thoughts, principles and quotes that I  have come to appreciate over my 30 years on this planet we call Earth.

## On Life 

1. Spend your time with people who add value to your life. Don’t waste time on those that don’t.
2. Read books. Not only do you learn but they’re a great avenue to help you escape.
3. If a book is bad, stop reading it. Life is too short to read books you don’t enjoy.
4. Dads, take as much time as you can off work when your baby is born - whether that’s paternity leave, shared parental leave or annual leave. You’ll never get that time back.
5. You can’t optimise every part of your life.

~I’ve been guilty of trying to do this. Sometimes you have to let go and see what happens.~

6. Pause and think about your new idea for at least a week before committing.

~Something I’ve had to learn over the years. At one point I owned a silly amount of domain names because I rushed to quickly to set up an idea I had, only to never touch it again.~

7. Enjoy sports but don’t let them consume you. When Cardiff lost, it used to ruin my Saturday. They’re pretty bad so that happened a lot.
8. The best way to discover a city’s culture is through the food.
9. Cats > Dogs
10. As a new parent, everyone will want to give you advice but take most with a pinch of salt. Every baby is unique, you’ll learn what works for yours.

## On Work & SEO 
1. Set clear expectations - at work and in your personal life
2. Feedback is important - even if it’s uncomfortable.
3. In-house > agency
4. Forget vanity metrics. Connect your impact  to what’s important to the business.
5. Don't copy what works well for others. Each site and audience is different; test and learn what works for yours.
6. Try to finish every day at inbox zero. It’ll bring clarity and help you start the next day focused on what’s important.
7. Keep a log of your wins, recognition and feedback you receive. It’s useful to take stock of what you’ve achieved and for when you are experiencing self-doubt or imposter syndrome. I call mine my “good vibes document” - I got the inspiration from [Julia Evans' 'Brag Doc'](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/).
8. Say thanks and give recognition - even if it feels lame or insignificant. You never know what it’ll mean to someone.
9. Tailor your CV for every job you apply for. A generic CV is obvious to a hiring manager.
10. [You don’t have to have a side project to be a successful SEO.](https://scott-salter.com/posts/side-project-successful-seo/)

## On Growth & Learning

1. Get comfortable being uncomfortable. It’s where you grow.
2. After every training course or piece of content you consume, ask yourself what 3 things you can implement today.
3. Why is one of the most important questions you can ask yourself and others.
4. Take notes. But don't just take notes, make notes. Your notes should be atomic.
5. Focus on systems, rather than tools.

## Quotes & Inspiration

1. "This too shall pass" - a Persian adage, but one of Abraham Lincoln's favourite motos.
2. "Sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage. Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it." - Benjamin Mee, We Bought A Zoo
3. “Learn how to get stuff done” - Barack Obama
4. “Every storm runs out of rain” - Maya Angelou
5. “A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought — they must be earned.” - Naval
