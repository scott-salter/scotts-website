I recently turned 30  in what was a  month of milestones. As well as a momentous birthday, I celebrated my first wedding anniversary with my wife and had my first Father’s Day as a dad.

I decided to put pen to paper (figuratively speaking) and ponder over 30 lessons, thoughts, principles and quotes that I  have come to appreciate over my 30 years on this planet we call Earth.

## On Life 

* Spend your time with people who add value to your life. Don’t waste time on those that don’t.

* Read books. Not only do you learn but they’re a great avenue to help you escape.

* If a book is bad, stop reading it. Life is too short to read books you don’t enjoy.

* Dads, take as much time as you can off work when your baby is born - whether that’s paternity leave, shared parental leave or annual leave. You’ll never get that time back.

* You can’t optimise every part of your life.

*I’ve been guilty of trying to do this. Sometimes you have to let go and see what happens.*

* Pause and think about your new idea for at least a week before committing.

*Something I’ve had to learn over the years. At one point I owned a silly amount of domain names because I rushed to quickly to set up an idea I had, only to never touch it again.*

* Enjoy sports but don’t let them consume you. When Cardiff lost, it used to ruin my Saturday. They’re pretty bad so that happened a lot.
* The best way to discover a city’s culture is through the food.
* Cats > Dogs
* As a new parent, everyone will want to give you advice but take most with a pinch of salt. Every baby is unique, you’ll learn what works for yours.

## On Work & SEO 

* Set clear expectations - at work and in your personal life
* Feedback is important - even if it’s uncomfortable.
* In-house > agency
* Forget vanity metrics. Connect your impact  to what’s important to the business.
* Don't copy what works well for others. Each site and audience is different; test and learn what works for yours.
* Try to finish every day at inbox zero. It’ll bring clarity and help you start the next day focused on what’s important.
* Keep a log of your wins, recognition and feedback you receive. It’s useful to take stock of what you’ve achieved and for when you are experiencing self-doubt or imposter syndrome. I call mine my “good vibes document” - I got the inspiration from [Julia Evans' 'Brag Doc'](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/).
* Say thanks and give recognition - even if it feels lame or insignificant. You never know what it’ll mean to someone.
* Tailor your CV for every job you apply for. A generic CV is obvious to a hiring manager.
*  [You don’t have to have a side project to be a successful SEO.](https://scott-salter.com/posts/side-project-successful-seo/)

## On Growth & Learning

*  Get comfortable being uncomfortable. It’s where you grow.
* After every training course or piece of content you consume, ask yourself what 3 things you can implement today.
* Why is one of the most important questions you can ask yourself and others.
* Take notes. But don't just take notes, make notes. Your notes should be atomic.
* Focus on systems, rather than tools.

## Quotes & Inspiration

* "This too shall pass" - a Persian adage, but one of Abraham Lincoln's favourite motos.
* "Sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage. Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it." - Benjamin Mee, We Bought A Zoo
* “Learn how to get stuff done” - Barack Obama
* “Every storm runs out of rain” - Maya Angelou
* “A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought — they must be earned.” - Naval
